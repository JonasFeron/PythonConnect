PythonConnect Licensing
============================================

This file attempts to include all licenses that apply within PythonConnect (this program) source tree, in particular any that are supposed to be exposed to the end user for credit requirements for instance. 

PythonConnect provides access to the full power of Python 3 (latest version) directly within any C# application. 
With Anaconda3 preinstalled to set up the Python environment, PythonConnect seamlessly manages communication between Python and C#, running in parallel asynchronous threads. 
This facilitates the effortless execution of Python scripts, smooth data exchange, and seamless integration of Python libraries (e.g., NumPy) into C# workflows.
